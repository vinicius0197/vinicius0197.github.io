This is a simple first test post for this blog. I'm still trying to find out what exactly I will be writing about here, and in what language (English or Portuguese, why not both?). For now, this is supposed to be a personal blog where I will write about a bunch of things that appeal to me, mainly coding and Computer Science, but maybe also writing and books.

So, a little bit of coding to start things out the proper way:

{% highlight python %}
def say_hello():
  print('Hello World!')

if __name__ == __main__:

  say_hello()

{% endhighlight %}

That's it for now.
