# 60 Day Challenge: Building a SaaS business from scratch

Building a successful SaaS business is a dream for a lot of internet entrepreneurs. Also, with a wide range of frameworks and supporting products that are available, building one from scratch on your own is not a far-fetched goal.

I've been reading and learning a lot about SaaS business in those last months. An excellent resource for that is the [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/) website, created by Courtland Allen. In his podcast, Courtland interviews the founders of successful internet businesses which are usually small, bootstrapped in nature. Around this time, I've been also learning how to code. I've spent the last months of 2018 learning React for front-end development (my main resource for learning was the excellent e-book **The Road to learn React**, by Robin Wieruch. You can visit his website [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/)).

Learning, reading and listening to podcasts about entrepreneurship is all fine and well, but I know that you need to get your hands dirty and start building if you really want to receive feedback and improve. As someone who is very interested in internet business and technologies in general, I've decided to give myself a challenge for this year of 2019: I'm going to build a SaaS business in 60 days.

## Okay, how I'm going to do this?

First and foremost, 60 days is the timeline for me to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product, a term popularized by the Eric Ries in his famous book, *The Learn Startup*). As a novice programmer, this is really going to be a challenge. I'm going to develop the front-end, the back-end API, create the design myself and make sure everything is working well in this timeframe. As someone who has never build anything of this scale before, I'm pretty sure this is going to be a valuable learning experience.

The main goal for those 60 days is to build something worth paying for. After this period, I will try to find some paying customers to receive feedback on the product and make sure that the problem I'm solving is important enough. I will reiterate on this cycle a couple of time, polishing the product, but the goal is to have the main thing working after the end of these 60 days.

How I've reached this 60 days number is not really important. Probably this is more than enough time for an experienced developer to build something on his own (especially if he/she has enough time under his belt). But I'm a beginner, so I've estimated that 60 days is challenging enough that I will have to put in a lot of effort to get things done, but realistically enough so that it is possible. Of course, this depends a lot on what I'm actually going to build, right?

## What is the product?

Looking for a business idea is one of the first things an aspiring entrepreneur gets caught thinking about. We usually put a lot of effort in trying to discover the cleverest, most inspiring idea ever.

I'm probably guilty of doing this. I've spent the last three months or so thinking about what would I build during this challenge. I've brainstormed a lot of potential business ideas that I find interesting, but my final decision was on building a budgeting app for your personal finances, similar in spirit to Ynab (which is a product that a lot of people use, myself included). Reason being that controlling my spending is a pain point for me, so this is a problem that I identify with.

There are a lot of budgeting apps out there, but I think there is still a market for this idea here in Brazil (where I live). Also, a personal budgeting app should be (relatively) simple enough that a one-man founder could build something of value.

## What will be the tech stack?

For the tech folks out there, I will be using React for the front-end (as mentioned), since it's the first front-end framework that I've learned, and it's very popular. For the backend, I will be using Django since Python is my favorite programming language ever and I've taken a course in Django development (I will probably use Django REST framework as well since the backend will just be an API). I haven't decided where I will host the app, but maybe Digital Ocean.

Design and UX/UI will be a tough one. I don't have a background in design, so I will be learning a lot of principles and best practices on my own.

## So let's start hacking

I've started this challenge on January 1st. From here, I will give myself 60 days to have a small, functional MVP, with basic budgeting functionality and responsive UI, and I will be blogging about (almost) everything that I learn along the way. Luckily this will be a valuable learning experience for me, and I hope it will help you as well on your own projects!

Happy 2019!
